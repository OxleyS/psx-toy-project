- TODO:
	- Set up 2D clipping rect every frame
	- Set up projection variable h

- Use malloc3 instead of malloc. Fixes a bug that causes fragmentation
- I think MGS created an OT for individual objects, but essentially treated each level poly as a separate object.
	- Evidenced by Snake being visible through door as soon as it opened
	
- RotTrans works with origin at top left, I think. RotTransPers, though, puts origin at center. But -Y is still up (wtf lol)
