<!-- MKPSXISO example XML script -->

<!-- <iso_project>
	Starts an ISO image project to build. Multiple <iso_project> elements may be
	specified within the same xml script which is useful for multi-disc projects.

	<iso_project> elements must contain at least one <track> element.
	
	Attributes:
		image_name	- File name of the ISO image file to generate.
		cue_sheet	- Optional, file name of the cue sheet for the image file
					  (required if more than one track is specified, not needed if you don't use CD-DA).
-->
<iso_project image_name="dist\derp.bin" cue_sheet="dist\derp.cue">

	<!-- <track>
		Specifies a track to the ISO project. This example element creates a data
		track for storing data files and CD-XA/STR streams.
	
		Only one data track is allowed and data tracks must only be specified as the
		first track in the ISO image and cannot	be specified after an audio track.
		
		Attributes:
			type		- Track type (either data or audio).
			source		- For audio tracks only, specifies the file name of a wav audio
						  file to use for the audio track.
			
	-->

		<!-- <identifiers>
			Optional, Specifies the identifier strings to use for the data track.
				
			Attributes:
				system			- Optional, specifies the system identifier (PLAYSTATION if unspecified).
				application		- Optional, specifies the application identifier (PLAYSTATION if unspecified).
				volume			- Optional, specifies the volume identifier.
				volume_set		- Optional, specifies the volume set identifier.
				publisher		- Optional, specifies the publisher identifier.
				data_preparer	- Optional, specifies the data preparer identifier. If unspecified, MKPSXISO
								  will fill it with lengthy text telling that the image file was generated
								  using MKPSXISO.

		<!-- <license>
			Optional, specifies the license file to use, the format of the license file must be in
			raw 2336 byte sector format, like the ones included with the PlayStation Programmer's Tool
			SDK in PS\CDGEN\LCNSFILE.
			
			License data is not included within the MKPSXISO program to avoid possible legal problems
			in the open source environment... Better be safe than sorry.
			
			Attributes:
				file	- Specifies the license file to inject into the ISO image.

		<!-- <directory_tree>
			Specifies and contains the directory structure for the data track.
			
			Attributes:
				None.

		<directory_tree>
		
			<!-- <file>
				Specifies a file in the directory tree.
					
				Attributes:
					name	- File name to use in the directory tree (can be used for renaming).
					type	- Optional, type of file (data for regular files and is the default, xa for
							  XA audio and str for MDEC video).
					source	- File name of the source file.

			<file name="main.exe"	type="data"	source="build\main.exe"/>
			
			<!-- <dir>
				Specifies a directory in the directory tree. <file> and <dir> elements inside the element
				will be inside the directory.
			-->
			<dir name="oxm">
			
				<!-- All <file> and <dir> elements here will be inside mydir -->
				
				<file name="test.oxm" type="data" source="asset\test.oxm"/>

				<!--<dir name="mystreams">-->
				
					<!-- Specifies a file as XA audio -->
					<!--<file name="mymusic.xa" type="xa" source="mymusic.xa"/>-->

					<!--<file name="mymovie.str" type="str" source="mymovie.str"/>-->

				<!--</dir>-->
			
			</dir>
			
			<!-- <dummy>
				Specifies an invisible dummy file to be generated into the file system. Use this to
				add dummy sectors, usually at the end of the file system portion of the image to prevent
				'drive runaway' problems.
				
				The dummy file is completely invisible as it is not added into the directory records
				of the ISO image entirely, ensuring a clean directory structure when the file system is
				viewed.
				
				Attributes:
					sectors	- Size of dummy file in sector units (1024 = 2MB).
